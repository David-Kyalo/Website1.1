    <p>In the bleak mid winter, Asguard stood on the slab facing the chilly slopes of St. Perencia hills. Ofcourse the mist barred him from seeing the foot of the hill where a bustling Mulei Town had just picked pace and shops were opening. It was a beutiful sight to behold, especially one who is about to adopt a life of a fugitive.</p>
